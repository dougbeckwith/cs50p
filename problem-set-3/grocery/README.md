# Grocery List Manager

## Description

The **Grocery List Manager** is a Python program designed to help you create and manage your grocery list. It allows you to add grocery items, keep track of their quantities, and print a sorted list of items in alphabetical order. This tool simplifies the process of organizing your shopping needs.

## Usage

1. **Clone or Download** the Repository:

   To use the Fraction to Percentage Converter, you need to clone or download the repository to your local machine. You can do this by clicking on the "Code" button and selecting your preferred method.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:

   Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the Python script (`fuel.py`) using the `cd` command.

3. **Run the Program**:

   Execute the following command to run the program:

   ```bash
   python fuel.py
   ```

4. **Adding Grocery Items**:

   The program will prompt you to enter grocery item names. You can continue adding items one by one. Input is not case-sensitive; all item names are converted to uppercase for consistency.

5. **Quantities**:

   The program keeps track of the quantities of each item. If you add the same item more than once, the program will increment its quantity.

6. **Viewing and Sorting**:

   You can view the grocery list by printing it. The list will be sorted in alphabetical order based on the item names.

7. **Quit the Program**:

   To exit the program, press `Ctrl-D` (or `Ctrl-Z` on Windows) when prompted for the next item. The program will display the final grocery list.

## Example

1. Apples
2. Bananas
3. Apples (again)
4. Cucumbers
