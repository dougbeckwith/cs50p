# Greeting Classifier

The Greeting Classifier is a simple Python program that takes user input in the form of a greeting, processes it, and provides a response based on specific conditions.

## Usage

1. Run the program by executing it with a Python interpreter.

   ```bash
   python bank.py
   ```

2. Enter your greeting when prompted.

3. The program will respond with a financial reward based on the input greeting.

## Input

The program expects the user to provide a greeting as input.

## Output

The program evaluates the input greeting and responds with one of the following rewards:

- If the greeting starts with "hello," it prints "$0."
- If the greeting starts with "h" but is not "hello," it prints "$20."
- If the input does not match any of the conditions above, it prints "$100."

## Example

```plaintext
Greeting: Hello, world!
$0
```
