# Expression Evaluator

This Python program is designed to take an expression in the format "x operator z" from the user, where `x` and `z` are numbers, and `operator` is one of the basic mathematical operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`. It then calculates the result of the expression and prints it with one decimal place.

## Usage

1. Run the program by executing it with a Python interpreter.

   ```bash
   python interpreter.py
   ```

2. Assume that the userâ€™s input will be formatted as x operator z, with one space between x and operatory and one space between operator and z.Assume that, if y is /, then z will not be 0

3. The program will extract the numbers and the operator, calculate the result, and display it with one decimal place.

## Example

```plaintext
Expression: 5 + 3
8.0
```
