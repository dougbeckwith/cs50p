# Deep Thought

This Python script prompts the user to answer the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything and then evaluates their response. If the answer matches "42", "forty-two", or "forty two," it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No."

## Usage

1. Run the script by executing it with a Python interpreter.

   ```bash
   python life_universe_everything.py
   ```

2. Enter your answer when prompted.

3. The script will respond with either "Yes" or "No" based on your answer.

## Input

The script expects a user input as a response to the question.

## Output

- "Yes" if the answer matches "42," "forty-two," or "forty two" (case-insensitive and without leading/trailing whitespace).
- "No" if the answer does not match any of the valid responses.

## Example

```plaintext
What is the Answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything? Forty-Two
Yes
```
