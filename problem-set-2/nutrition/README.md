# Fruit Calorie Counter

## Description

The Fruit Calorie Counter is a Python program that allows users to find the calorie count of various fruits. It contains a dictionary with the names of common fruits and their corresponding calorie counts. Users can input the name of a fruit, and the program will display the calories for that fruit.

## Usage

1. To run the program, execute the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python nutrition.py
   ```

2. You will be prompted to enter the name of a fruit.

3. Enter the name of the fruit you want to know the calorie count for. The program is case-insensitive, so you can use uppercase or lowercase letters.

4. If the entered fruit is found in the dictionary, the program will display the calories for that fruit.

## Example

Let's use an example to see how the Fruit Calorie Counter works. Suppose you want to find the calorie count of an apple and a kiwifruit:

```plaintext
Enter a fruit name: apple
Calories in Apple: 130

Enter a fruit name: kiwifruit
Calories in Kiwifruit: 90
```
