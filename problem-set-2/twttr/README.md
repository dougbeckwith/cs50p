# Remove Vowels from a String

## Description

The "Remove Vowels from a String" Python program is a simple script designed to eliminate vowels from a user-provided input string. Vowels, which include 'a,' 'e,' 'i,' 'o,' and 'u,' are removed from the input string, and the resulting string is displayed.

## Usage

1. Run the program by executing the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python twttr.py
   ```

2. You will be prompted to input a string.

3. Enter the string you want to process, and the program will eliminate the vowels from it.

4. The program will display the resulting string with all the vowels removed.

## Example

Suppose you want to remove vowels from the string "Hello, World!" Here's how you can use the "Remove Vowels from a String" program:

```plaintext
Input: Hello, World!
Hll, Wrld!
```

In this example, the user inputs "Hello, World!", and the program processes it, removing all the vowels ('e' and 'o'). The resulting string "Hll, Wrld!" is displayed.
