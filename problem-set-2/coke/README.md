# Coin Change Calculator

## Description

The Coin Change Calculator is a Python program designed to assist users in calculating change owed when coins are inserted for a given purchase amount. The program accepts coins with denominations of 5, 10, and 25 cents and calculates the change owed.

## Usage

1. Run the program by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python coke.py
   ```

2. You will be prompted to insert coins.

3. Enter coins with denominations of 5, 10, or 25 cents.

4. The program will display the updated amount due and, once the amount is paid in full, it will show the change owed.

## Example

Suppose you have a purchase amount of 50 cents, and you want to calculate the change owed. Here's how you can use the Coin Change Calculator:

```plaintext
Insert a Coin: 10
Amount Due: 40
Insert a Coin: 25
Change Owed: 15
```

In this example, the user first inserts a 10-cent coin, reducing the amount due to 40 cents. Afterward, a 25-cent coin is inserted, covering the full purchase amount of 50 cents. The program then displays the change owed, which is 15 cents.

The program continues to prompt the user for coins until the full purchase amount is reached or exceeded.
