# Hangman

#### Description:

The Hangman Game is a classic text-based game implemented in Python. It offers an engaging and entertaining experience where players attempt to guess a secret word letter by letter. However, they must be cautious, as a limited number of incorrect guesses are allowed before the game concludes.

#### Gameplay Features:

1. **Random Word Selection**: Each game starts with the selection of a random word from a predefined list.

2. **Interactive Gameplay**: Players input their guesses by providing a single letter. The game checks for valid inputs and ensures that each letter is guessed only once.

3. **Visual Feedback**: The current state of the word is displayed, revealing guessed letters and placeholders for the remaining ones. The game also features a visual representation of the hangman to track incorrect guesses.

4. **Game Outcome**: The game ends when the player successfully guesses the entire word or exhausts the allotted attempts. In both cases, the correct word is revealed to the player.

5. **Play Again Option**: After each game, players have the option to play again. The program selects a new random word, and the gameplay continues.

#### How to Play:

1. Run the game by executing the `hangman.py` file.
2. Enter a single letter to make a guess.
3. Continue guessing until you either correctly guess the word or run out of attempts.
