# Making Faces

The Emoji Text Converter is a Python program that allows you to enter text, and it will replace specific emoticon strings with corresponding emoji characters.

## Getting Started

To run this program on your local machine, you need to have Python installed. If Python is not already installed, you can download and install it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the script directly.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dougbeckwith/cs50p.git
$ cd cs50p/problem-set-0/faces
```

2. Run the script using your preferred Python interpreter.

```bash
$ python faces.py
```

3. Enter your text, and the program will automatically replace ":)" with a smiling face emoji and ":(" with a sad face emoji.

## Example

```bash
$ python faces.py
Enter some text: Hello, world! :)
Hello, world! ðŸ˜Š
```

This example demonstrates how the program works, taking "Hello, world! :)" as input and replacing each ":)" with ðŸ˜Š.
