# Indoor Voice

This Python program prompts the user for input and converts it to lowercase before printing it to the terminal.

## Getting Started

To run this program on your local machine, you need to have Python installed. If Python is not already installed, you can download and install it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the script directly.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dougbeckwith/cs50p.git
$ cd cs50p/problem-set-0/indoor
```

2. Run the script using your preferred Python interpreter.

```bash
$ python indoor.py
```

3. Enter the text when prompted. The program will convert the text to lowercase and display the result on the terminal.

## Example

```bash
$ python indoor.py
Enter text: Hello, World!
hello, world!
```

This example demonstrates how the program works, taking "Hello, World!" as input and converting it to lowercase.
