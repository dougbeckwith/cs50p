# Tip Calculator

The Tip Calculator is a Python program that calculates the tip amount based on the cost of a meal and the desired tip percentage. It's a handy tool for determining how much to leave as a tip after a meal.

## Getting Started

To run this program on your local machine, you need to have Python installed. If Python is not already installed, you can download and install it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the script directly.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dougbeckwith/cs50p.git
$ cd cs50p/problem-set-0/tip
```

2. Run the script using your preferred Python interpreter.

```bash
$ python tip.py
```

3. You will be prompted to:

   - Enter the cost of the meal (in the format '$##.##')
   - Enter the tip percentage (in the format '##%')

4. The program calculates the tip amount by multiplying the meal cost by the tip percentage and then displays the resulting amount to be left in the terminal.

## Example

```bash
How much was the meal? (in the format '$##.##'): $25.00
What percentage would you like to tip? (in the format '##%'): 15%
Leave $3.75
```
