# Playback Speed

This Python program prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space with ... (i.e., three periods).

## Getting Started

To run this program on your local machine, you need to have Python installed. If Python is not already installed, you can download and install it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the script directly.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dougbeckwith/cs50p.git
$ cd cs50p/problem-set-0/playback
```

2. Run the script using your preferred Python interpreter.

```bash
$ python playback.py
```

3. Enter the text when prompted. The program then outputs that same input, replacing each space with ... (i.e., three periods).

## Example

```bash
$ python playback.py
Enter: This is CS50
Output: This...is...CS50
```

This example demonstrates how the program works, taking "This is CS50" as input and replacing each space with ... (i.e., three periods).
