# Einstein

The Einstein is a simple Python program that allows you to calculate the equivalent energy (in joules) for a given mass (in kilograms) using the famous equation E=mc^2.

## Getting Started

To run this program on your local machine, you need to have Python installed. If Python is not already installed, you can download and install it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the script directly.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dougbeckwith/cs50p.git
$ cd cs50p/problem-set-0/einstein
```

2. Run the script using your preferred Python interpreter.

```bash
$ python einstein.py
```

3. Enter the mass in kilograms to calculate the equivalent energy in joules

## Example

```bash
$ python einstein.py
Enter mass in kg to calculate the number of joules: 1
90000000000000000
```

This example demonstrates how the program works, taking a mass of 1 kilogram as input and calculating the equivalent energy in joules.
